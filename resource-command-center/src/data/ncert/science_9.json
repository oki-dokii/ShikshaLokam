(iii) Explain why water does not gather in the hollowed-out portions of A and D.",
    "answer": "(i) Water accumulates in the hollowed portions of B and C as a difference in the water concentration is observed. Thereby, endosmosis occurs as the cells act as a semipermeable membrane. (ii) Potato A is essential in this experiment as it is significant to compare different scenarios seen in potato cups B, C and D. Potato A in this experiment clearly shows that the potato cavity on its own cannot bring about water movement. (iii) Cup in A does not show any change in the water flow concentration for osmosis to occur, which requires concentration to be higher than the other. Cells in cup D are dead; thus, there is no existence of a semipermeable membrane for water flow. Consequently, osmosis does not occur."
